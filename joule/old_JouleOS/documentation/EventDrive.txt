my best Idea for event driven stuff so far is to have a special thing to allocate
an event "stack" this "stack" has a limit of 254(linked list stuff in 0 and 255)
though you can have multiple stacks
for every device, console, or other control type thing you have to install an event into the event stack
such as for make a console you would install an event into whatever base number you want and then it would install events for things like keyboard input, clicking, console changes, ect
installing the events of the console but not actually having them point to a function and then
in the default event(which is called when any event happens) have it put something in a message stack
or whatever
you can also always poll everything like in dos, rather than install events you can just do things
like gets and such only when you want to or are waiting for something

for internals and drivers:
they are responsible for installing and uninstalling events..
to install you should store... the pid, the event stack address, and the event number to be used for your
events
