####DEVICE SUB-SYSTEM####
I have all the port stuff worked out now...
GlobStruct is still not done and all of the standard device
functions are not currently listed anywhere


####DEVICES####
Currently no standard devices are made


####GUI####
There currently is no GUI


####CONFIG FILES####
The design is in /docs/ ...
currently some command line options are supported
they include ?L_com:"file.com", ?L_bin:"file.bin", ?log:"logfile.txt"
