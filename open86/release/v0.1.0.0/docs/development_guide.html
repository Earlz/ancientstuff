--1. What is this!?--
This file describes how to modify Open86, Create a plugin/device, and gives useful info for creating an OS under
Open86. About anything you'll need to know will be here. If you need to know something not listed here then 
goto <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/open86">http://sourceforge.net/projects/open86</a> and then submit a support request or post on the forum


--2. The basic design aspects of Open86--
The main goal of Open86 is to create a portable, free, opensource x86 emulator. To make it portable
I must interpret every opcode byte-by-byte into the correct code to be emulated, which is slow compared to other
methods.
    Open86's big thing is that it will support external devices(unlike any other emulator I've seen) so that 
you can make a device with nothing but gcc and my special header file for GlobStruct. Also, with Open86 you will be
able to test your OS under special conditions not easily done in other emulators. For instance, you can specify to
only use 8086 opcodes, so that you can see that your OS will work on a plain 8086
   Open86's target audience is not only devlopers but also average users that want to use an OS that they can't
run on their PC, or if they don't want to risk destroying their PC


----Modifying the Open86 core:------

--3. The basics to modifying source--
For almost every source file you will need to include "_base.h" as it contains almost
everything that Open86 uses

more later..

--4. Adding files to the MakeFile--
Adding files to be made is quite simple. First, Open up the MakeFile. Next, goto under the target default. Right below the
nasm command type:(without quotes) "gcc $(_CFLAGS) MyFile.c -o .objs/MyFile.o" Next find "_OBJS=" and add to 
the list: ".objs/MyFile.o" (without quotes)



--5. How to access registers--
Accessing registers is pretty simple in Open86. To access 8bit general registers just use something like *gregs8[AH];
To access the 16 bit general registers just use gregs16[AX]; and for segment registers use sregs[DS]; For ip
just use the variable "ip". Finally, to access the flags register you can either use the unsigned short version
which is flagreg; or you can use the easier, bitfield'ed flags-&gt;; which is a struct and just use something like
flags-&gt;zf; and thats the zero flag. Note! the interrupt flag is accessed by flags-&gt;_if
   In a lot of my code I use the macros doeip; and doiptr; these functions calculate eip for me and doiptr; will
automatically update the variable iptr so that it points to [cs:ip] in the emulated memory(but we can access it from
the actual computer)


--6. Creating Instructions--
Creating Instructions is a tad bit complicated, but it's easy once you've done it 2 or 3 times
First, decide where your instruction function should go, find something that suits it in instructions/
if it doesn't really seem to fit anywhere then you can either create a new file(and add it to the makefile) or
you can put it in instructions/ect.c
   Now instructions are simple void instruction_operand(void) type functions. so just create your function
I'm assuming that you'll read the rest of this document to figure out what you need for actually coding the instruction.
When you finally get the instruction code done, then just add the function prototype to "_base.h" at the bottom with
all the other instruction prototypes(around line 212 or so.) We must add a function prototype to get the address of
the function without C going crazy. 
   Finally, now all you do is open up main.c and find the "InitOpcodes()" function and at the bottom of
the function(but still in the function) add this line of code "InstallOp(OPCODE_VALUE,OPCODE_FUNCTION);" replacing
the words in caps to their appropriate values. Now you can test it or whatever..


--7. Adding command line arguments--
Adding a command line argument is pretty easy but in your argument you MUST have 1 pair of double quotation marks(")

finish later..

--8. Creating internal port functions--
To create a port handler inside the core is quite simple. First, you create the function with this format:
in=MyPort(out,in_or_out,size_of_data); --size of data is in number of bytes --in_or_out is 1 for in and 0 for out
When you create the function all you have to do is ports[MY_PORT_NUMBER]=&amp;MY_PORT_FUNCTION; and put that code somewhere
before DoCpu() in main() (you should see a few other port things there.) Note that you may need to prototype your port in _base.h


--9. Calling Device Functions--
doing later...

--10. Portable Considerations--
Open86 is meant to be portable so you must isolate any OS-dependent code using #ifdef stuff
also for pointer arithmetic involving adding pointers don't assume that pointer size is 4, instead
use "sizeof(void *);"


----Creating or editing an Open86 device:------


--11. Making a simple device--
Making devices for Open86 is quite simple, though it does require a bit of "startup code." I assume that you know how
to build a runtime linkable library for your OS! First (assuming you have a blank main.c) copy Open86_Device.h to the
directory of your source files, Then add to your main.c #include "Open86_Device.h". Now you need to add a function
to get the GlobStruct pointer(this is required!) so use this little template
//code//
GlobalDevice *GlobStruct;
#define EXPORT //whatever you have to add to make sure the symbol is shared/exported
unsigned int EXPORT Open86Init(GlobalDevice *_globstruct){
  GlobStruct=_globstruct;
  return 0; //this should not return 0 if their was an error
}
//end code//
Now just build and use the command Open86 ?L_dev:"MY_DEVICE" to test it(might need to specify a file also to load and run
though..




--12. About GlobStruct--
GlobStruct is the magic struct that contains almost all the data for Open86. It includes CPU state(registers and such),
all of the device handles, port pointers, ect. It is REQUIRED for most every useful device as without it you wouldn't have
access to anything in Open86


--13. Accessing Registers(using GlobStruct)--
Accessing registers is quite simple and easy once you got GlobStruct recieved and saved. To access 8 bit general registers
you just(assuming your GlobStruct is named GlobStruct) use *GlobStruct-&gt;_gregs8[AH]; To access 16bit general
registers you use GlobStruct-&gt;_gregs16[AX]; To access 16 bit segment registers use GlobStruct-&gt;_sregs[DS];
And to Access ip you use *GlobStruct-&gt;ip  Finally to access flags you can either use the unsigned short type which is
*GlobStruct-&gt;_flagreg; or you can use the easier method like *GlobStruct-&gt;_flags-&gt;zf; would be for zero flag.


--14. Creating a port function--
Creating an extern port function is very similar to creating one internal, you just have to add GlobStruct to it! To
Create a port function you can follow this template:
in=MyPort(out,in_or_out,size_of_data){} --size of data is in number of bytes --in_or_out is 1 for in and 0 for out
Next, we need to install the port function. We do this by doing somethign like:
*GlobStruct-&gt;_ports[PORT_NUMBER]=MyPortFunction;


--15. Portable considerations--
Read 10. Portable considerations (under Modifying the Open86 core)

--16. 


--17. Complete list of standard devices
note: in this list I don't tell what ports the device is responsible for, as this varies too much by specific model emulated
another note: these only include the specific device functions, there still needs to be Open86Init and friends

--list of funcitons in every device
This is a list of functions that should be in every device(even if it does nothing)

(unsigned int)error=Open86Init(GlobalDevice *GlobStruct);
this is called for initialization and to give you GlobStruct

(unsigned int)error=Open86Signal(unsigned int signal,void *extra_data,unsigned int size_of_exta_data);
This is called when Open86 needs to send a signal, such as for shutting down, pausing, reset, ect.
list of signals:
0: shutdown signal; extra_data points to nothing; doesn't do anything but warn if error isn't 0
1: pause signal; extra_data is device handle of who paused it; panics if the return wasn't 0
no other signals..yet..
2: resume signal; extra_data is nothing; panics if the return isn't 0
4: reset signal;extra data points to nothing; panics if return isn't 0
beware that reset or shutdown may be sent after pause before resume


--name: std_Video
--description: This is responsible for handling anything video related except actually displaying it
--functions:
void SetResolution(unsigned int width,unsigned int height, unsigned char bpp, unsigned char graphical);
this function will set the current resolution. graphical should be 0 for text modes or 1 for graphic modes
bpp means bits per pixel, for text modes this has to be either 3 or 4(8 colors for multiple fonts or 16 colors for usual operation)
for graphics modes it can be anything

void PutPoint(unsigned int x,unsigned int y, unsigned int character_or_color);
for graphics modes character_or_color is jsut the pixel color. for text modes it is
in the format of 1st(lowest) byte being character and color being the second byte. the upper 2 bvtes are ignored

(unsigned int)character_or_color=GetPoint(unsigned int x,unsigned int y);
this is like the above except it gets a point or character

(unsigned int)width=GetaWidth(void);
(unsigned int)height=GetaHeight(void);
(unsigned int)bpp=GetaBpp(void);
these 3 functions are for the gui, this is NOT the emulated display mode, this is the 
display settings of how the DoneBuffer in std_Gui.VideoRefresh() should be rendered
(remeber the video adapter is responsible for converting characters to pixels, NOT the monitor)


(unsigned int)width=GetWidth(void);
(unsigned int)height=GetHeight(void);
(unsigned int)bpp=GetBpp(void);
(unsigned char)graphical_or_text=GetGraphical(void);
these are what the emulation enviroment sees, graphical_or_text is 0 for text or 1 for graphical

(unsigned int)size=SizeOfVideoRam(void);
This gets the size of the video ram in bytes

--responsible to call:
std_Video is responsible for calling these functions at the appropriate time:
void std_Gui.VideoRefresh(void *DoneBuffer,unsigned int buffer_size);
This should be called whenever the video should be refreshed, DoneBuffer is a rendered buffer(renders text to pixels, and possibly resizes small video sizes, applies overscan..)
buffer_size is only provided to prevent accidental overflow, GetaWidth and friends should used to determine the display settings


--name:std_Gui
--description: This is basically a virtual enviroment, it is responsible for telling the mouse and keyboard that it has received something. It also is 
responsible for telling Open86 that the power button has been pushed(or reset) and anything else a user might do with the outside of the computer
--functions:
void VideoRefresh(void *DoneBuffer,unsigned int buffer_size);
this function is called by std_Video whenever the video display should be changed
for  example it is called whenever: the video is refreshed, the display mode is changed, the color pallete is changed, the fonts are changed, ect

--responsible to call:
std_Gui is responsible for calling many different things and it may call more or less than listed here.

void std_Keyboard.PushedKey(unsigned int scancode);
this should be called when a key is pressed, scancode is of type int because of things like unicode..

void std_Keyboard.ReleasedKey(unsigned int scancode);
this should be called when a key is released

void std_Mouse.Changed(unsigned int x,unsigned int y,signed int scroll_moved, unsigned char click_data);
this should be called when the mouse is moved or clicked, click_data is in the format of bits as 0(lowest bit):left click 1: middle click 2: right click
scroll_moved is positive if it is scrolling up or negative if scrolling down, it's 0 if it wasn't moved
note that x and y are absolute and are not always at  the same place as it says it is in the emulator

void Open86.PowerButton(void);
this should be called if the emulated power button is pushed, this will turn off the emulator

void Open86.Pause(void *MyDeviceHandle);
This will send the pause signal to every device except the on specified in the argument, this also pauses the cpu
note: this isn't really required but rather is optional

(unsigned int)error=std_Video.ResizeVideo(unsigned int width,unsigned int height);
Not all video emulation will support this, error should be 0 if it was a success, if it isn't 0 then you should NOT change the size of the window
because the video emulation doesn't  support it and may corrupt the display
if error is 1 then it isn't supported at all. if error is 2 then it just isn't supported in this video mode(so you can try it in other modes)
